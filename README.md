# git_errors

### # Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary, 
 # especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch. 
 # # Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts # the commit.

It's not a Git error message, it's the editor as git uses your default editor.

To solve this:

    press "i" (i for insert)
    write your merge message
    press "esc" (escape)
    write ":wq" (write & quit)
    then press enter
